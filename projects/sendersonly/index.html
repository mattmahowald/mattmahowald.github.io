                <h2>About Rodney</h2>
                <p>Rodney is a five-year-old kindergarten student from East Palo Alto attending <a href="http://setonpaloalto.org/">St. Elizabeth Seton</a> in Palo Alto.</p>
                <p>I tutored Rodney twice a week for thirty minutes, working on topics from counting to geometry to comparisons and operations.</p>
                <p>Rodney's favorite food is Pizza, and his favorite color is blue.</p>

                    <h2>Counting</h2>
                    <p>Over the course of the quarter, Rodney's counting improved immensely. The most tangible improvement came in rote counting. On day one, Rodney could successfully count to nineteen, but he often jumped to a random base-ten number like sixty instead of twenty. By the final counting session, Adrian (a classmate of Rodney, tutored by Amanda) and Rodney counted one hundred cups together. A major breakthrough involved connecting with Rodney through sports, which I used to get him to reset at zero without any hesitation. Grouping was more difficult, because we could not group basketball dribbles or times tossing a die. I discovered that Rodney liked absurd stories, so we put bears on top of cookies covered in sprinkles (represented below), which magically helped Rodney group by five, something he could not do the first week. Of the other skills, Rodney has cardinality down. He can clearly (see image) represent using numbers. His transitions from x9 to (x+1)0 are almost there, he needs a little bit more practice with the numbers larger than fifty. And finally, the next step is moving up to base-ten. I can't wait to keep working with Rodney next month.</p>

                <h2>Geometry</h2>
                <p>Shapes were Rodney's enemy at the start of the geometry unit. I had just cracked his rough exterior with counting, and then we found ourselves back to square one. To make matters worse he only knew the names circle, square, and triangle, but he couldn't assign the correct name to the corresponding shape. After a week of failed attempts to use tangrams and rubber band boards, I brought a basketball and headed to the outdoors, where Rodney and I found huge success. With large printouts of the shapes, I called out the name of the shape that Rodney had to run to before I would throw him the ball. Eventually, I let him name the shape, and I would run to it. By the end, he was able to name every shape. By the time we brought it back inside, Rodney could make the shapes using cups or the rubber band board, and he could describe their qualities.</p>
