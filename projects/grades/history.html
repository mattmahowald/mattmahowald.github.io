                        Unsurprisingly, grades in the United States date back to the earliest universities. According to the Harvard Faculty Records on April 2, 1877, Harvard began using a percent system in the late nineteenth century to classify students into different groups of achievement. This event preceded the invention of a single letter representing a percentage of information retained or level of success achieved in the class. These were labeled as “Divisions,” with six buckets, not unlike today’s ubiquitous system. Division 1 earned a high achieving grade, somewhere in the range of 95% achievement, while Division 6 earned a failing mark with under 50% retention. <br><br>
                        Similar grading systems swept the country. Michigan published in 1895 a set of adjectives regarding a slightly more pessimistic outlook on grades: Passing, Incomplete, Conditioned, Not Passed, Absent. This system clearly has many more students in the upper echelon of grades, showing the iterative process of refinement the United States grading system took in order to become what it is today. After many more iterations, Mount Holyoke in 1897 published the first letter grade system, mapping percentages and qualitative descriptors to letters A-E, before F replaced E to designate failure. Mark Dunn introduces the question in his chronology of the history of grading, “As the record reveals, the history of grading in schools in the United States is replete with trial and error. Is it the best we can accomplish?” (1).<br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        To better answer the question, we first must introduce the importance of grades. In Timothy Quinn’s book On Grades and Grading, the answer is laid out: <br><br>
                        1.  Grades can provide data upon which to base decisions<br>
                        2.  Grades can have a tremendous impact on student motivation.<br>
                        3.  Grades can provide students with important feedback on their work. (xiii)<br><br>
                        Let’s unpack that. The first purpose of grades, according to Quinn, lies in the necessity to evaluate students’ absolute and relative performance in school in order to amass data informing any decisions to be made regarding hiring or accepting the student. Secondly, grades provide a useful method of giving students a tangible goal to strive for, although as we will see, this is more of a double-edged sword, causing anxiety and stress in students along with the motivation. And finally, grades allow the student to see progress on a purely quantitative scale, allowing insight into areas needing improvement. In addition, many believe that grades provide an extra fire in students, encouraging competition much like winning within a sports team. This argument, however, even further exacerbates the notion of school as dog-eat-dog environment where few succeed and many fail, whereas it should be viewed as a collaborative environment to encourage the success of everyone.<br><br>
                        Dunn eventually answers his own question of whether this system is the best we can do with the simple two words, “Probably not,” (1). Although this system clearly conforms to the purposes of grades as laid out by Quinn, with  data to evaluate, motivate, and inform students, there still remain many problems. Upon introduction to the history of grades, Dunn introduces a common question heard by teachers across the country: “‘Is that information going to be on the test?’ This question is one teachers often hear from students. When instructors hear this, they should realize those particular students probably consider grades a higher priority.” (1). The question highlights the issue that the grading system produces. Instead of acting as a motivator to get students to study even harder than they otherwise would, grades become the only important product. Grades become the paramount objective for students, overcoming the interest to learn that should be taught instead. Once a student ascertains that a topic will be on an assessment, the student can then make the decision to fully invest resources, namely effort and time studying, to truly learn the material. On the other hand, if a student discovers a topic not to be on an assessment, the student then can entirely dismiss the topic, when in reality the topic could potentially come back to play a role in the student’s education as a whole. <br><br>
                        This style of grading is completely informed by the banking model of education, in Freire's terms. It assumes that the teacher (or more accurately, the state) is in charge of deciding what material is relevant, which knowledge is intended to be deposited into the minds of the students. Grades reflect how much of that knowledge is successfully transferred. It does not capture knowledge creation as a process resulting from a dialogue between teacher and student. This is especially difficult for students whose identities and backgrounds are consistently ignored by teachers' curriculum. Many students and parents from ethnic minorities raise the objection that teachers tend to only teach the contributions of Western civilization, ignoring the culture and values of all other groups of people. For this reason, many students feel alienated by the curriculum itself, and view grades and tests as only tangentially related to the material they truly want to learn about, that is most relevant to their own lives.
                        <br><br>
                        This sentiment is true across the board. Telling students a topic will not be tested equates to giving the student permission to turn off, even for many of the best students. In my own education, I’ve been an offender of tuning out. My introductory computer science class introduced a concept called “threading” as the last lecture of the course. Threading is a complex process that allows a computer program to do multiple things at one time. Instead of digging into the weeds of how threading worked, I instead prioritized my time studying the past material to assure I would have a successful final exam. Although I saw the fruits of my labor in my final exam, as the next class rolled around I immediately felt behind. Clearly, this grade system imposes a cap on students’ learning potential, but why and how?

                        <h3>Thought Questions:</h3>
                        Consider the following quesions.<br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>What are changes that are happening in today's society that might influence how we wish to grade students?</li>
                        <li>Listed above were three important functions of grades. What are they? How might each of these functions be performed by a tool other than traditional grading?</li>
                        <li>How did you personally respond to grading in school? Did your peers respond similarly? How did others respond differently?</li>
                        </ol>
