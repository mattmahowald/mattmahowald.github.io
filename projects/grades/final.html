                        <h3>Why We Made This</h3>
                            During our visits as AVID tutors to Cesar Chavez middle school, we engaged in discussions with the students on their perspectives on school and grades. It appeared that nearly all of them felt that there was too much pressure on them to get high grades, causing immense stress. At the same time, nearly all of them felt that grades were an important, valid metric that is used by college admissions to filter out applicants. Many of them would ask Matt and I if we had a 4.0 GPA in high school in order to get into Stanford. Matt and I realized that grades may be acting more as a demotivator for these students than as a motivator for academic achievement. Those who didn't believe that they could get perfect grades found little intrinsic motivation to work their hardest on their assignments. This module is intended to help students and teachers create a system of grading that internalizes an intrinsic love of learning.

                        <h3>How to Navigate</h3>
                        The pages presented here are intended to be navigated sequentially. After reading and engaging with the content on each topic, you should consider the thought questions that follow and write some notes in order to see how your understanding of grades changes throughout the module. Then, progress to the next section and repeat. Finally, in the reflection section, we will ask you to write a few, short responses to questions to gauge your learning over the course of the module. Thanks!
                        <h3>Thought Questions:</h3>
                        Before we get started, consider the following quesions.<br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Do you feel that your current grading system accurately assesses the ability and performance of your students? How might you improve this?</li>
                        <li>Do you feel that your current grading system provides feedback that help your students improve their skills? How might you improve this?</li>
                        <li>Do you feel that your current grading system motivates your students to succeed academically? How might you improve this?</li>
                        <li>What other advantages and disadvantages does your current grading system have? Would your students agree?</li>
                        </ol>
