                        <h3>In-School Activities</h3>
                        <p>These concepts are not limited to the classroom. On the schoolgrounds, there are still many places linguistic diversity has an impact. One of the most important, especially for young students, is on the playground. As children, we learn much of our social skills from play. The playground is an opportunity for us to practice interactions with others in a safe environment. This is an opportunity for teachers and administrators to apply this new pedagogy to instill the values CSP promotes. Through advocating for inclusive games that celebrate heritage, students will learn the ability to appreciate their own and other's cultures, as well as gain a respect for those different from them.</p>

                        <h3>Families and Communities</h3>
                        <p>Similarly, as a teacher or administrator, you are in position through attending parents' association meetings to inform parents to improve the community to adopt this mindset of accepting those of different </p>
                        <h3>Thought Questions</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <ul>What kinds of games and activities can you think of that promote sharing your culture or other cultures? How can you think about integrating students into these games, and what if they are hesitant at first?</ul>
                            <ul>Role play: what might you do if you face this situation? A student tells you he doesn't want to play with another student because the other student does not share the same color skin.</ul>
                            <ul>At a parent-teacher conference, what can you do to encourage your student's parents to increase the home's recognition of linguistic diversity?</ul>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Thank you for reading through our material! We hope you enjoyed the blended learning experience hearing from multiple perspectives. Take some time to fill out the reflection section that follows so that you can come full circle in understanding how this mini course has changed your perception of linguistic diversity in the classroom.</p>
