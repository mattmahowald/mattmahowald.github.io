                        <h1>Heteroglossia in the classroom</h1>
                        <p>Now that you have an understanding of what heteroglossia looks like, let’s discuss applications of heteroglossia in the classroom. In 1997, Michelle Grijalva documented an application of heteroglossia through the eyes of a school called Tuba City High. There, the literature taught in 1988 consisted of Beowulf, Shakespeare, and Wordsworth—literature written predominantly by white males.</p>

                        <p>Not only is this strategy flawed for <i>any</i> classroom as discussed in the <a href="heteroglossia.html">previous section</a>, but in this classroom in particular, the curriculum did even more damage. Tuba City sits on an Native American reservation, where much of the heritage of the student body hailed from the roots of the area. As we learned in the <a href="csp.html">Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy section</a>, it is important for pedagogy and curriculum to target students culture to preserve heritage and identity. Here the teachers missed an opportunity to provide students with connection to their culture through literature.</p>

                        <p>In fact, teachers at the school were so misinformed of the importance of culture, one was documented as saying that bringing in the Native literature was an attempt to take us all back to the age in which humans lived in caves.</p>

                        <p>Grijalva in her own class at the University of Arizona, however, demonstrates her pedagogical prowess by exposing to the students the power of understanding cultural, historical, and political importance of the Navajo tribe through select readings from literature from the area. As a result, the students walked away with assumptions and procenceptions replaced with appreciation and respect.</p>

                        <h3>Thought Questions</h3>

                        <p>After reading about the literature selection in Grijalva's excerpt, think back to your schooling as well as the classrooms you may have taught in. How has the pedagogy within those classrooms supported the students? How has the curriculum and literature helped or hurt the preservation of your, your classmates', or your students' heritage?</p>
