                        This website is intended for teachers to be able to work more effectively with diverse student populations. This module focuses specifically on linguistic diversity.
                        By the end of this module, you will be able to take concrete steps toward increasing your sense of teacher efficacy in working with students of linguistic diversity.
                        <br><br>

                        <h3>What is linguistic diversity?</h3>
                        <br>
                        More than 6000 languages are spoken worldwide. Even within the same language, many people speak the language in different ways, using different vocabulary, grammar, or pronunciation. In fact, it can be said that no two people use language in exactly the same way. The way in which we use language is shaped by our parents, our peers, our teachers, the media, and countless other sources of influence. As a result, every classroom is filled with students whose varied backgrounds have produced language differences.
                        <br><br>
	                   Many times, schools strip away students’ native language and culture in efforts to assimilate them. They will ask parents to speak English to the students at home, punish them for using their native language, or withhold education until the students have achieved mastery. These students are marginalized and either implicitly or explicitly told that their use of language is inferior to others’. Throughout this module, you will develop your ability to foster and sustain cultural and linguistic pluralism in your classroom. Along the way, please take the time to answer each section’s thought questions designed to tie the content with your own experiences.
                        <br><br>
                        <h3>How to Navigate</h3>
                        The pages presented here are intended to be navigated sequentially. After reading and engaging with the content on each topic, you should consider the thought questions that follow and write some notes in order to see how your understanding of linguistic diversity changes throughout the module. Then, progress to the next section repeatedly. Finally, in the reflection section, we will ask you to write a few, short responses to questions to gauge your learning over the course of the module. Thanks!
                        <h3>Thought Questions:</h3>
                        <br>
                        Before we get started, consider the following quesions.
                        1. What kinds of linguistic diversity are represented in your classroom? <br>
                        2. Have you witnessed or participated in the devaluation of particular students’ use of language? How did you respond? Would you respond differently now? <br>
                        3. What goals can you set for yourself in regard to more effectively teaching a linguistically diverse classroom?
