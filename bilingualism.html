                        <h3>Models of Bilingual Education</h3>
                        <p>A bilingual education is a form of heteroglossia where two cultures are forced to be engaged through two different languages in the classroom. In the typical United States bilingual classroom, deemed by Sonia Nieto in <i>Affirming Diversity</i> as the “transitional bilingual education,” the main goal is to teach students English as a second language. In this model, the student receives a timeframe in which she is supposed to be fully fluent in English without any need for her native language.</p> 

                        <p>Although this is a popular and viable model, a more applicable bilingual education model to the topic of linguistic diversity is referred to by Nieto as the “maintenance bilingual education,” where the goal is not to transition the student from a native language to English, but rather to preserve both, giving the student the asset of a second language as well as preserving the culture that comes with it.</p>

                        <p>In addition, another model that aligns with the principles of applying heteroglossia is the “two-way bilingual education,” in which students of the minority language integrate with students of the majority language. In this model, our culturally sustaining pedagogy is achieved, as students from all backgrounds interact and acquire a mutual respect and understanding of all cultures.</p>

                        <p>Over the course of the history of the United states, bilingual education has had supporters and dissentors. An interesting proposed reason for dissent is the issue of patriotism. One's ability to transition from a language, for example German post World War II, has served as a proxy for love of the United States. In this right, many U.S. presidents have vocally condemned bilingual education, including Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan. Roosevelt is quoted as saying, "We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language," clearly betraying his disregard for a bilingual education. In fact, as evidenced by our study of heteroglossia and culturally sustaining pedagogy, a bilingual education supports the popular Bush-regime movement of "No Child Left Behind."</p>

                        <h3>Thought Questions</h3>
                        <p>As a last thought excercise before moving out of the classroom, think about the following questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How has your perception of people been influence by the languages they speak, and how might that have changed if they learned English from childhood?</li>
                            <li>On the other hand, how might your perception of people who speak languages other than English change if you had grown up in a "two-way bilingual" school? Or if you did, how might your assumptions be different if you had not?</li>
                            <li>What are some of the disadvantages of the bilingual education models proposed above? Do they set students back from those receiving a traditional, monolingual education in a single-language-speaking population?</li>
                        </ul>
