                        <h1>Alternative Systems</h1>
                        <p>
                        Many schools and school systems have already recognized the cognitive dissonance between trying to convince students to care more about learning and less about grades, while simultaneously evaluating students entirely on grades. With that understanding, there have been attempts at every level of education, some of them more successful than others, to teach students to adopt a true growth mindset. 
                        <br><br>According to the UC Santa Cruz website, until 2001 grades at the university had no quantitative measure attached. Instead grades, “focused on narrative descriptions written by the professors that evaluated student performance and assessed the students’ strengths and weaknesses.” This system became dubbed the Narrative Evaluation system, and its aim was to attach less of an academic pressure on achieving highest marks on strictly test material. Instead, Santa Cruz hoped students would take the opportunity to invest in learning the material. The noble campaign became too much of a burden on students, as jobs became scarce, and a GPA-less resume became taboo. Ultimately, the Santa Cruz case study demonstrates the difficulty in overcoming the behemoth system that stands today, while also indicating the importance of retaining a quantitative measure to aid universities and organizations attempting to evaluate applicants.
                        <br><br>Stanford graduate schools, on the other hand, have been able to entirely replace the grading system. In particular, the medical school and the business school do not publish grades to anyone but the students. Although untraditional, the system functions on two main principles. First, the schools assume that a student graduating from either school will be distinguished enough not to have trouble in seeking a job. Secondly, Stanford knows that with this extra freedom, its students will still be able to achieve a high enough level of excellence in order to verify each student’s ability in the professional world.
                        <br><br>This juxtaposition of grading systems shows us that context matters. A stanford graduate degree demonstrates a certain level of intelligence and specialization such that grades are not needed. The degree itself verifies each student’s ability. On the other hand, in the case of UCSC, attempting to be a trend-setter in lightening the burden on students did not yield the same results, because it ultimately caused students trouble in demonstrating what they had learned in a quick, succinct way like a GPA. </p>

                        <br><br><p>So what do we do? Clearly, grades can hurt education. They often provide unnecessary stress imposing upon students, forcing students to sacrifice moral integrity for simple letters and numbers tagged with their names. They can create a cap on students’ potential learning with a maximum grade. So why have legislators and education system designers not figured this out and disposed of them altogether? Well, we need them. As clearly indicated by the case of UC Santa Cruz, large education systems need some normalized methodology to evaluate students on a large scale, especially with grades nationally standardized and embedded deep in the fabric of the educational system. The real problem boils down to two main offenders: organizations like schools and businesses that focus too specifically on GPAs to admit applicants, creating an unnecessarily competitive grading system, as well as the teachers themselves who fail to uphold their end of the deal of informing students the true meaning of a grade. The system needs to install into teacher training and certification the importance of growth mindset psychology and its interplay with grades. If all teachers can have success like Jaime Escalante, the efficacy of teachers will transcend the grade system itself. Similarly, organizations evaluating students must take more of a holistic look, rather than evaluating students so heavily on quantitative results. Recently, Harvard has already taken strides, eliminating the SAT as a required portion of the application. Hopefully, with these changes implemented properly, school can become the ideal forum for education and enrichment that it aspires to be.
                        <h3>Thought Questions:</h3>
                        Consider the following quesions.<br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>How might implementing a qualitative grading system benefit the students in your classroom? What are the disadvantages?</li>
                        <li>Which of your students' attributes do you think are most important to be measured? Are these attributes captured by your current grading system? If not, do you think they should be? </li>
                        <li>What goals are your students setting for themselves? Are they related more to tangible results or the process of learning? Do you think that students have a clear sense of their goals in the first place? Have they been given the opportunity to reflect on these goals in the classroom? </li>
                        </ol>
