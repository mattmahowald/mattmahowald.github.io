                        <h1>Culture</h1>
                        <p><br><br>The first place we should start in discussing culture diversity is the term culture itself. How do we unpack so broad of a concept? A working definition that we can use for the purpose of this lesson is that culture is “a way of life” of a group of people, involving shared behaviors, beliefs, values, and symbols. Culture encompasses a multitude components, including languages and dialects, nonverbal communications, and worldviews and perspectives. There usually exist cultural practices that exist within a group. Cultures are also always changing as its individual members, associated groups, and external environment change. For this reason, it is important to recognize that it is impossible to classify cultures in a systematic way. Through this module, when we refer to different cultures, it should not be assumed that these cultures define its members or that those who participate are one cohesive group.<br><br>
    Historically, the mainstream culture in the United States has been Western European. As a result, the learning style pattern predominantly used in classrooms is based on Western European symbols, behaviors, and language. Does this learning style pattern optimally educate students who do identify with this culture? Based on research, it would appear not.<br><br>
    Based on observation-based descriptions of groups of learners, white American learners tend to most value independence, analytic thinking, objectivity, and accuracy. This translates into learning experiences that focus on competition, tests, grades, and linear logic, which are prevalent in most American schools. Research on African American culture indicates a higher valuation of oral experiences, physical activity, and loyalty in interpersonal relationships. This makes activities like discussion, active projects, and collaborative work preferable. Mexican-American learners generally regard family and personal relationships as priorities and are comfortable with cognitive generalities, performing best when they have a close interpersonal connection with the teacher and are working with broad concepts rather than specifics. Native American students generally value and develop acute visual discrimination, have reflective thinking patterns, and perceive globally. Teachers would best serve these students by providing a context for new information, providing quiet time for thinking, and emphasizing visual stimuli.<br><br>
    Of course, these descriptions should not be used to force students into a particular way of learning based on stereotype. A consistent finding in studies on culture is that within a group, the variations among individuals are as great as their commonalities. Rather, these descriptions are included to provoke insights into how the cultural value system a student brings to the classroom will also affect the ways in which a teacher can best serve him or her. A teacher of a culturally diverse classroom has the responsibility of being aware of the different values represented by his students, and encouraging students to learn in diverse ways that align with diverse values. <br><br>

<h3>Thought Questions:</h3><br>
1. What types of cultures are represented in your classroom?<br><br>

2. Can you think of ways in which your teaching style may favor students of one culture? <br><br>

3. Generate three ideas that you can use in the classroom to diversify your instructional style.<br><br>
