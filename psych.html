                        In order to understand the effects of the grading system on students’ performance, it’s important to understand what happens psychologically as students receive grades, bad or good. As Denise Pope explains in her book Doing School, students do not go to school to learn to learn. In fact, Pope proposes students don’t even go to school to learn at all. Instead students go to school to get good grades. Students aim to get good grades in order to get accepted into a good college, to get a well-paying job, and ultimately to become happy. This desire to achieve high grades consumes the student, devouring ability to learn and replacing it with an urgent necessity for an A, even at the cost of cutting corners (Pope). In my own subjective experience, I have witnessed this across the board. My classmates copy computer code for classes, read Sparknotes to get the summary of a book, make up data instead of collecting it—all because of the insatiable thirst for an A. Each student does not want the experience and knowledge, just a stamp of approval. As I do research among my peers to explore this topic further, it is convincingly so. The reason, however, lies in the complex psychology of mindsets in students—something that the incentive-based grade system does not take into account.</p>

                          <br><br><p>Stanford psychology professor Carol Dweck first introduced the importance of mindsets after decades of research attempting to understand the difference in achievement among students. What Dweck proposed is a clear, binary distinction between the mindsets of students who improve greatly and students who remain stable in school: the difference between a growth and a fixed mindset. Dweck observed the behavior of students within these two groups to characterize the difference. In her book Mindset: The New Psychology of Success — How We Can Learn to Fulfill Our Potential, Dweck introduces the qualities of these two groups. People with the growth mindset think with the following mentality: “They knew that human qualities, such as intellectual skills, could be cultivated through effort. And that’s what they were doing—getting smarter. Not only weren’t they discouraged by failure, they didn’t even think they were failing. They thought they were learning.” On the other hand, those with the fixed mindset “thought human qualities were carved in stone. You were smart or you weren’t, and failure meant you weren’t. It was that simple. If you could arrange successes and avoid failures (at all costs), you could stay smart. Struggles, mistakes, perseverance were just not part of this picture,” (12).
                        <br><br>
                        This ties into the sociological phenomenon known as stereotype threat. It has been shown to affect some minorities taking standardized tests, who perform lower as an effect of the social perception of their race being less intelligent than other groups. The stronger the student identifies with the negatively stereotyped group, the higher the impact of stereotype threat. Importantly, the subject does not need to believe the stereotype in order for the effect to take place. A possible explanation for this is the idea of fixed mindset. If a student has been told implicitly and explicitly throughout his or her life that he or she is less capable due to an inborn trait, such as race, the student is much more likely to be discouraged by failure and accept that his or her intelligence has a ceiling. Teachers can help alleviate this effect by fostering an environment which transforms fixed mindsets into growth mindsets.
                        <br><br>For example, take Jaime Escalante, a teacher from Garfield High School in East Los Angeles. Jaime inherited a classroom of low-achieving, mostly Mexican-American students of the lowest socioeconomic status. A fixed mindset group, the students had never passed Algebra II—but in reality they should not have made it past middle school math. Jaime took the reins in on the classroom, making the material approachable and most importantly teaching the students to attack problems without fear of failure. As a result, his entire class passed the AP Calculus exam two years later. Not only is this exam one of the most difficult math exam nationally available to high school students, but “in 1987, only three other public school in the country had more people taking the Advanced Placement Calculus test. Those three included Stuyvesant High School and the Bronx High School of Science, both elite math-and-science-oriented schools in New York,” (Dweck 82). Clearly, Jaime inspired an enormous change in cognitive ability within his classroom. 
                        <br><br>What made these students different from most school systems? The bottom line is, in Dweck’s words, “people are a lot more capable than we think,” (80). When students don’t achieve as highly as anticipated, there exists some psychological boundary between failure and success. Instead of adopting the Jaime Escalante classroom mindset, students aim to achieve only what is required in order to get an A, or a satisfactory grade for any given student. Jaime’s classroom had the advantage of beginning without the preconceived notion that grades are more important than learning because they did not care about either. Instead, Jaime succeeded in pushing them to the goal of learning calculus. Grades prevent students from being able to do so.
                        <h3>Thought Questions:</h3>
                        Consider the following questions.<br>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Do you students find stress from grades? If so, does this stress motivate them or demotivate them? Can you think of ways to increase student motivation?</li>
                        <li>Approximately what percentage of your students show attributes related to a growth mindset in relation to education? What percentage appear to have a fixed mindset? What percentage have an understanding of this dichotomy at all?</li>
                        <li>Can you think of factors of a student's background and identity that can influence his or her growth or fixed mindset? Are some demographics affected more than others by these factors?</li>
                        </ol>
